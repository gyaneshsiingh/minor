**Project Title:**  
**Prediction of Semiconductor Wavelengths from UV-Induced Color Emission**

**Status:** âœ… _Completed_

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project focuses on the development of a machine learning model to **predict the emission wavelength of semiconductor materials** under UV light based on their visible color response. The aim is to bridge visual observation with quantitative spectral analysis using a lightweight, data-driven approach.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Develop a system that can estimate the **wavelength of light emitted** by semiconductor samples under UV exposure.
- Leverage computer vision for **color detection** from UV-illuminated images.
- Use a regression model to map **RGB values to physical wavelengths** in the visible spectrum.

## ðŸ§  Key Features

- ðŸ“· **Frame Extraction** using OpenCV2 from UV-illuminated video clips or images.
- ðŸŽ¨ **Color Detection & Normalization** using color space conversion and averaging.
- ðŸ“ˆ **Linear Regression Model** trained to predict **wavelength (in nm)** from color data.
- ðŸ“Š Achieved **90%+ prediction accuracy** on test samples within the visible range (approximately 380â€“750 nm).

## ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies

- **Python 3.x**
- **OpenCV2** â€“ for image/frame processing
- **NumPy / Pandas** â€“ for data handling
- **Scikit-learn** â€“ for building and evaluating the regression model
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** â€“ for data visualization and result interpretation
